# Microbiome Analysis Dashboard

This is a comprehensive tool for 16S rRNA microbiome data analysis, from raw FASTQ files to advanced statistical modeling and reporting, featuring an interactive Dash-based user interface.

## Features

-   End-to-end pipeline: FASTQ quality filtering, ASV table generation (via VSEARCH), and taxonomy assignment.
-   Core microbiome metrics: Alpha and Beta diversity, PCoA, PCA, and NMDS.
-   Advanced statistics: PERMANOVA, differential abundance testing, indicator species analysis, and mixed-effect models (GEE & Bayesian ZINB).
-   AI-powered assistance for parameter suggestion and results interpretation (requires Google Gemini API key).
-   Automated PDF report generation.
-   Interactive data visualization with Plotly and Dash.

## Installation

1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  You will also need to have `vsearch` installed and accessible in your system's PATH, or you must update the path to the executable in `microbiome_analysis_tool/pipeline_steps.py`.

## Usage

1.  **Prepare your data:**
    -   Create a folder (e.g., `my_project_data`).
    -   Place your paired-end FASTQ files (e.g., `Sample1_R1.fastq.gz`, `Sample1_R2.fastq.gz`) in this folder.
    -   Place your metadata file (CSV or TSV format) in the same folder. The first column must be the sample IDs.
    -   If you have a SILVA database for taxonomy assignment, name it `silva.fasta` and place it in this folder.

2.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```
3.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8050`.

4.  **In the dashboard:**
    -   Enter the path to your data folder (e.g., `./my_project_data`).
    -   Click "List Files in Folder" to confirm the files are detected.
    -   Set the analysis parameters manually or use the AI suggestion features.
    -   Click "Run Analysis" to start the pipeline.
